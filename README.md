# Hostility_measure

This repository contains the generator code for the artificial datasets and some results of the Hostility measure from paper "Hostility measure for multi-level study of data complexity".
 - **Artificial_data** has the code to generate the bivariate and multivariate Normal artifical data.
 - **Visual_analysis** collects the graphical analysis comparing different state-of-art complexity measures for all artificial datasets.
 - **Filter_experiment** contains, for all datasets, the evolution of errors when the more complex points are eliminated.
